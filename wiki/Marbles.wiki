#summary The so called marble diagrams of various implemented operators

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

This page lists the various operators and shows a marble diagram about how they relay events. These operators are static methods of the Observables utility class

= Details =

== accumulate(Observable< T > xs, Func2< T, T, T > f) => Observable< T > ys ==

Accumulate the Ts by using the function and relay each intermediate value to the output. The first input is just relayed as is, and starting from the second input the function is applied.

== accumulate(Observable< T > xs, T seed, Func2< T, T, T > f) => Observable< T > ys ==

Accumulate the Ts and relay each intermediate value to the output. The accumulator starts whith the given seed value.

== accumulate0(Observable< T > xs, T first, Func2< T, T, T > f) => Observable< T > ys ==

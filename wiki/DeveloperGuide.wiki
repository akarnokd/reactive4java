This page gives a guide/tutorial about how to write your an interactive and/or reactive operator, which cannot be expressed by using the !Reactive4Java library's operators via composition.

As a general rule for implementing an operator:

  * follow the types,
  * know what the operator should do: create a marble diagram first,
  * think about exception cases carefully,
  * think about concurrency carefully,
  * think about cancellation carefully.

You should read the [UserGuide user guide] first to understand the library's fundamentals.

#summary Library helper methods

= Introduction =

This page lists all helper methods that lets you connect the default types and operators of the Java world and the !Reactive4Java library.

= Actions =

The {{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Actions}}} utility class lists static helper methods that can be used to work with the {{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Action0}}} and {{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Action1}}} classes, which involves typical transformations from and to {{{Runnable}}}s. See [http://reactive4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Reactive4Java/docs/javadoc/hu/akarnokd/reactive4java/base/Action0.html javadoc].

|| *Method* || *Description* || *Javadoc* ||
|| {{{noAction0()}}} || Returns an {{{Action0}}} instance which does nothing. ||  ||
|| {{{noAction1()}}} || Returns an {{{Action1}}} instance which does nothing. ||
|| {{{asRunnable(Action0)}}} || Wraps the {{{Action0}}} instance into a {{{Runnable}}}. ||
|| {{{asAction0(Runnable)}}} || Wraps the {{{Runnable}}} instance into an {{{Action0}}}. ||
|| {{{asAction1(Runnable)}}} || Wraps the {{{Runnable}}} instance into an {{{Action1}}} ||

= Functions =

The {{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Functions}}} utility class lists static helper methods that can be used to work with the {{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Func0}}},{{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Func1}}} and {{{hu.akarnokd.reactive4java.Func2}}} classes.

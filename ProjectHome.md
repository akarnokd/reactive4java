This library has been superseded by [RxJava](https://github.io/Netflix/RxJava). No further development will happen in Reactive4Java.

If you are looking for the Interactive part of the library, it has been [moved to my GitHub repository](https://github.com/akarnokd/ixjava-experiment) and updated to be compatible with RxJava 0.19.0. You need to check it out and build it by using Gradle in order to get the jars. I haven't so far asked for a contrib module in RxJava itself and this might or might not happen at all.
